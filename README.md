# restaurant-reviews

This restaurant-reviews application is an exercise following [Beau Carnes's](https://github.com/beaucarnes) MERN stack [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrHNSanmqQ4).

There are 3 major parts in the tutorial:
* Backend with Express ðŸ™‚
* Frontend with React :angry:
* Mongodb Realm deployment ðŸ˜¢

However, some features in the original tutorials are deprecated and must be coped with. ðŸ˜ž
Some workarounds are listed below by subtopics (Backend, Frontend, Mongodb Realm):

* Backend:
  * A deprecated function `substr()`
```javascript
// cuisine.substr(0,20)
cuisine.substring(0,20)
```

* Frontend:
  * <Switch> is deprecated in `react-router-dom` version 6 in favor of <Routes>. The document provides the  (supposed to be) solution "change the <Switch> import to <Routes>, change the component to element, etc.". But those solution introduces new error (the web page can't be rendered because of invalid hook call). The easiest solution is to downgrade the `react-router-dom` to version 5 by using the command line.
```
$ cd <pathto>/restaurant-reviews/frontend
$  # npm install react-router-dom
$ npm install react-router-dom@5  
```

* Mongodb Realm:
  * 3rd Party Services are deprecated ðŸ’¢ðŸ˜§. Use the Http Endpoints instead. The configuration interfaces are changed, especially the authentication configuration.
  * The function parameters are changed to `{ query, headers, body}, response` instead of `payload, response`.
 ```javascript
 // exports = async function(payload, response)  // old
 exports = async function({ query, headers, body}, response)
 ```
  * In `restaurants` function, the following code raises the `then is not a function` error (possibly because the mongodb version in the tutorial is older). The collection.count() function no longer returns the `Promise`.
  ```javascript
  await collection.count(q).then(num => num.toString())
  ```
  * The `collection.count(q)` returns the `long` number type, so the following code works.
  ```javascript
  await collection.count(q).toString()
  ```
